# One Month Rails

This is the sample application for my One Month Rails training. I'm excited to learn some practical Rails. Also, I hope that I learn more from not having to create a Twitter app that everyone else seems to be obsessed with making with Rails and instead learn from a more interesting photography-type app.

After this, and training some more on Rails with Noble Desktop, I'm looking forward to adding Ruby Motion to my repetoire and attending some training with their team in San Francisco. Between that, Rails, and my front end skills, I should be able to create an excellent working protype of my first web application here in 2014.
